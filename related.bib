    abstract = {{Action recognition in uncontrolled video is an important and challenging computer vision problem. Recent progress in this area is due to new local features and models that capture spatio-temporal structure between local features, or human-object interactions. Instead of working towards more complex models, we focus on the low-level features and their encoding. We evaluate the use of Fisher vectors as an alternative to bag-of-word histograms to aggregate a small set of state-of-the-art low-level descriptors, in combination with linear classifiers. We present a large and varied set of evaluations, considering (i) classification of short actions in five datasets, (ii) localization of such actions in feature-length movies, and (iii) large-scale recognition of complex events. We find that for basic action recognition and localization MBH features alone are enough for state-of-the-art performance. For complex events we find that SIFT and MFCC features provide complementary cues. On all three problems we obtain state-of-the-art results, while using fewer features and less complex models.}},

		 in objects, and on the body to create a sensor-rich
		 environment for the machine recognition of human
		 activities. We acquired data from 12 subjects
		 performing morning activities, yielding over 25 hours
		 of sensor data. We report the number of activity
		 occurrences observed during post-processing, and
		 estimate that over 13000 and 14000 object and
		 environment interactions occurred. We describe the
		 networked sensor setup and the methodology for data
		 acquisition, synchronization and curation. We report on
		 the challenges and outline lessons learned and best
		 practice for similar large scale deployments of
		 heterogeneous networked sensor systems. We evaluate
		 data acquisition quality for on-body and object
		 integrated wireless sensors; there is less than 2.5%
		 packet loss after tuning. We outline our use of the
		 dataset to develop new sensor network self-organization
		 principles and machine learning techniques for activity
		 recognition in opportunistic sensor configurations.
		 Eventually this dataset will be made public.},

	Abstract = {This paper exploits the context of natural dynamic scenes for human action recognition in video. Human actions are frequently constrained by the purpose and the physical properties of scenes and demonstrate high correlation with particular scene classes. For example, eating often happens in a kitchen while running is more common outdoors. The contribution of this paper is three-fold: (a) we automatically discover relevant scene classes and their correlation with human actions, (b) we show how to learn selected scene classes from video without manual supervision and (c) we develop a joint framework for action and scene recognition and demonstrate improved recognition of both in natural video. We use movie scripts as a means of automatic supervision for training. For selected action classes we identify correlated scene classes in text and then retrieve video samples of actions and scenes for training using script-to-video alignment. Our visual models for scenes and actions are formulated within the bag-of-features framework and are combined in a joint scene-action SVM-based classifier. We report experimental results and validate the method on a new large dataset with twelve action classes and ten scene classes acquired from 69 movies.},

	Abstract = {{Local space-time features have recently become a popular video representation for action recognition. Several methods for feature localization and description have been proposed in the literature and promising recognition results were demonstrated for a number of action classes. The comparison of existing methods, however, is often limited given the different experimental settings used. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate and compare previously proposed space-time features in a common experimental setup. In particular, we consider four different feature detectors and six local feature descriptors and use a standard bag-of-features SVM approach for action recognition. We investigate the performance of these methods on a total of 25 action classes distributed over three datasets with varying difficulty. Among interesting conclusions, we demonstrate that regular sampling of space-time features consistently outperforms all tested space-time interest point detectors for human actions in realistic settings. We also demonstrate a consistent ranking for the majority of methods over different datasets and discuss their advantages and limitations.}},

	Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to address recognition of natural human actions in diverse and realistic video settings. This challenging but important subject has mostly been ignored in the past due to several problems one of which is the lack of realistic and annotated video datasets. Our first contribution is to address this limitation and to investigate the use of movie scripts for automatic annotation of human actions in videos. We evaluate alternative methods for action retrieval from scripts and show benefits of a text-based classifier. Using the retrieved action samples for visual learning, we next turn to the problem of action classification in video. We present a new method for video classification that builds upon and extends several recent ideas including local space-time features, space-time pyramids and multi-channel non-linear SVMs. The method is shown to improve state-of-the-art results on the standard KTH action dataset by achieving 91.8% accuracy. Given the inherent problem of noisy labels in automatic annotation, we particularly investigate and show high tolerance of our method to annotation errors in the training set. We finally apply the method to learning and classifying challenging action classes in movies and show promising results.},

The recorded data consists of observations of naturally performed manipulation tasks as encountered in everyday activities of human life. Several instances of a table-setting task were performed by different subjects, involving the manipulation of objects and the environment. We provide the original video sequences, fullbody motion capture data recorded by a markerless motion tracker, RFID tag readings and magnetic sensor readings from objects and the environment, as well as corresponding action labels. In this paper, we both describe how the data was computed, in particular the motion tracker and the labeling, and give examples what it can be used for. We present first results of an automatic method for segmenting the observed motions into semantic classes, and describe how the data can be integrated in a knowledge-based framework for reasoning about the observations.},

	Abstract = {{It is generally accepted that children have sensorimotor mental representations for concepts even before they learn the words for those concepts. We argue that these prelinguistic and embodied concepts direct and ground word learning, such that early concepts provide scaffolding by which later word learning, and even grammar learning, is enabled and facilitated. We gathered numerical ratings of the sensorimotor features of many early words (352 nouns, 90 verbs) using adult human participants. We analyzed the ratings to demonstrate their ability to capture the embodied meaning of the underlying concepts. Then using a simulation experiment we demonstrated that with language corpora of sufficient complexity, neural network (SRN) models with sensorimotor features perform significantly better than models without features, as evidenced by their ability to perform word prediction, an aspect of grammar. We also discuss the possibility of indirect acquisition of grounded meaning through "propagation of grounding" for novel words in these networks.}},

	Abstract = {{We report a new phenomenon associated with language comprehension: the action-sentence compatibility effect (ACE). Participants judged whether sentences were sensible by making a response that required moving toward or away from their bodies. When a sentence implied action in one direction (e.g., "Close the drawer" implies action away from the body), the participants had difficulty making a sensibility judgment requiring a response in the opposite direction. The ACE was demonstrated for three sentences types: imperative sentences, sentences describing the transfer of concrete objects, and sentences describing the transfer of abstract entities, such as "Liz told you the story." These data are inconsistent with theories of language comprehension in which meaning is represented as a set of relations among nodes. Instead, the data support an embodied theory of meaning that relates the meaning of sentences to human action.}},

Although paraphrases often make use of synonymous or near synonymous terms, many previous approaches have either ignored or made limited use of information about similarities between word meanings. We present an algorithm for paraphrase identification which makes extensive use of word similarity information derived from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). The approach is evaluated using the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (Dolan et al., 2004), a standard resource for this task, and found to outperform previously published methods. 1},

Indeed, its performance of 86.36\% (LP/LR F 1 ) is better than that of early lexicalized PCFG models, and surprisingly close to the current state-of-the-art. This result has potential uses beyond establishing a strong lower bound on the maximum possible accuracy of unlexicalized models: an unlexicalized PCFG is much more compact, easier to replicate, and easier to interpret than more complex lexical models, and the parsing algorithms are simpler, more widely understood, of lower asymptotic complexity, and easier to optimize.}},

This paper describes the creation of the recently-released Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus, which contains 5801 sentence pairs, each hand-labeled with a binary judgment as to whether the pair constitutes a paraphrase. The corpus was created using heuristic extraction techniques in conjunction with an SVM-based classifier to select likely sentence-level paraphrases from a large corpus of topic clustered news data. These pairs were then submitted to human judges, who confirmed that 67\% were in fact semantically equivalent. In addition to describing the corpus itself, we explore a number of issues that arose in defining guidelines for the human raters.}},

The procedure consists of document pair extraction, sentence pair extraction, and fragment pair extraction. At each stage, we evaluate the intermediate results manually, and tune the later stages accordingly. With this minimally supervised approach, we achieve 62

% of accuracy on the paraphrase fragment pairs we collected and 67% extracted from the MSR corpus. The results look promising, given the minimal supervision of the approach, which can be further scaled up.},

	Abstract = {Recent work has shown promise in using large, publicly available, hand-contributed commonsense databases as joint models that can be used to infer human state from day-to-day sensor data. The parameters of these models are mined from the web. We show in this paper that learning these parameters using sensor data (with the mined parameters as priors) can improve performance of the models significantly. The primary challenge in learning is scale. Since the model comprises roughly 50,000 irregularly connected nodes in each time slice, it is intractable either to completely label observed data manually or to compute the expected likelihood of even a single time slice. We show how to solve the resulting semisupervised learning problem by combining a variety of conventional approximation techniques and a novel technique for simplifying the model called context-based pruning. We show empirically that the learned model is substantially better at interpreting sensor data and an detailed analysis of how various techniques contribute to the performance.},

	Abstract = {DISCERN is an integrated natural language processing system built entirely from distributed neural networks. It reads short narratives about stereotypical event sequences, stores them in episodic memory, generates fully expanded paraphrases of the narratives, and answers questions about them. Processing in DISCERN is based on hierarchically-organized backpropagation modules, communicating through a central lexicon of word representations. The lexicon is a double feature map system that transforms each orthographic word symbol into its semantic representation and vice versa. The episodic memory is a hierarchy of feature maps, where memories are stored ``one-shot''at different locations. Several high-level phenomena emerge automatically from the special properties of distributed neural networks in this model. DISCERN learns to infer unmentioned events and unspecified role fillers, generates expectations and defaults, and exhibits plausible lexical access errors and memory interference behavior. Word semantics, memory organization, and appropriate script inferences are automatically extracted from examples. DISCERN shows that high-level natural language processing is feasible through integrated subsymbolic systems. Subsymbolic control of high-level behavior and representing and learning abstractions are the two main challenges in scaling up the approach to more open-ended tasks.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for measuring semantic similarity/distance between words and concepts. It combines a lexical taxonomy structure with corpus statistical information so that the semantic distance between nodes in the semantic space constructed by the taxonomy can be better quantified with the computational evidence derived from a distributional analysis of corpus data. Specifically, the proposed measure is a combined approach that inherits the edge-based approach of the edge counting scheme, which is then enhanced by the node-based approach of the information content calculation. When tested on a common data set of word pair similarity ratings, the proposed approach outperforms other computational models. It gives the highest correlation value (r = 0.828) with a benchmark based on human similarity judgements, whereas an upper bound (r = 0.885) is observed when human subjects replicate the same task.},

Informally, a common-sense fact is a true statement about the world that is known to most humans: ""milk is white,"" ""touching hot metal hurts,"" etc. Several efforts have been devoted to collecting common-sense knowledge for the purpose of making computer programs more intelligent. Such efforts, however, have not succeeded in amassing enough data because the manual process of entering these facts is tedious. We therefore introduce Verbosity, a novel interactive system in the form of an enjoyable game. People play Verbosity because it is fun, and as a side effect of them playing, we collect accurate common-sense knowledge. Verbosity is an example of a game that not only brings people together for leisure, but also collects useful data for computer science.},
