	abstract = {We address a question answering task on real-world images that is set up as a Visual Turing Test. By combining latest advances in image representation and natural language processing, we propose Neural-Image-QA, an end-to-end formulation to this problem for which all parts are trained jointly. In contrast to previous efforts, we are facing a multi-modal problem where the language output (answer) is conditioned on visual and natural language input (image and question). Our approach Neural-Image-QA doubles the performance of the previous best approach on this problem. We provide additional insights into the problem by analyzing how much information is contained only in the language part for which we provide a new human baseline. To study human consensus, which is related to the ambiguities inherent in this challenging task, we propose two novel metrics and collect additional answers which extends the original DAQUAR dataset to DAQUAR-Consensus.},

abstract = {{This paper presents a novel pedestrian detection system for intelligent vehicles. We propose the use of dense stereo for both the generation of regions of interest and pedestrian classification. Dense stereo allows the dynamic estimation of camera parameters and the road profile, which, in turn, provides strong scene constraints on possible pedestrian locations. For classification, we extract spatial features (gradient orientation histograms) directly from dense depth and intensity images. Both modalities are represented in terms of individual feature spaces, in which discriminative classifiers (linear support vector machines) are learned. We refrain from the construction of a joint feature space but instead employ a fusion of depth and intensity on the classifier level. Our experiments involve challenging image data captured in complex urban environments (\ie, undulating roads and speed bumps). Our results show a performance improvement by up to a factor of 7.5 at the classification level and up to a factor of 5 at the tracking level (reduction in false alarms at constant detection rates) over a system with static scene constraints and intensity-only classification.}},

abstract = {{Remarkable performance has been reported to recognize single object classes. Scalability to large numbers of classes however remains an important challenge for today's recognition methods. Several authors have promoted knowledge transfer between classes as a key ingredient to address this challenge. However, in previous work the decision which knowledge to transfer has required either manual supervision or at least a few training examples limiting the scalability of these approaches. In this work we explicitly address the question of how to automatically decide which information to transfer between classes without the need of any human intervention. For this we tap into linguistic knowledge bases to provide the semantic link between sources (what) and targets (where) of knowledge transfer. We provide a rigorous experimental evaluation of different knowledge bases and state-of-the-art techniques from Natural Language Processing which goes far beyond the limited use of language in related work. We also give insights into the applicability (why) of different knowledge sources and similarity measures for knowledge transfer.}},
